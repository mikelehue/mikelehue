### 👋 Hi, I'm Miguel López Varga  

Physicist and experimentalist moving into the world of **Solutions Engineering** —  
the intersection where **technology, business, and people** meet.  

For the past years I’ve worked in **quantum optics**, building and automating experimental systems,  
writing **Python** code to control hardware, analyze data, and connect devices through **APIs**.  
Now I’m focusing on applying those same skills to **Cloud, AI, and SaaS environments**,  
where solving technical problems also means understanding business needs and communicating clearly.

### 💡 What I bring
- Strong technical background and analytical mindset (PhD in Physics).  
- Proficiency in **Python**, **data analysis**, and **API integration**.  
- Experience bridging **hardware and software**, **engineers and stakeholders**.  
- Curiosity and clarity when explaining complex ideas to non-technical audiences.

### 🌍 What I’m aiming for
Roles such as **Solutions Engineer**, **Pre-Sales Engineer**, or **Technical Consultant** —  
positions that combine **technical depth**, **customer interaction**, and **strategic thinking**.
